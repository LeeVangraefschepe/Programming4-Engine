# Minigin

Minigin is a very small project using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for 2D c++ game projects. It is in no way a game engine, only a barebone start project where everything sdl related has been set up. It contains glm for vector math, to aleviate the need to write custom vector and matrix classes.

# Goal

Minigin can/may be used as a start project for the exam assignment in the course 'Programming 4' at DAE. In that assignment students need to recreate a popular 80's arcade game with a game engine they need to program themselves. During the course we discuss several game programming patterns, using the book '[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)' by Robert Nystrom as reading material. These patterns need to be applied (when applicable) as well as all (most) [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

# Disclaimer

Minigin is, despite perhaps the suggestion in its name, not a game engine. It is just a very simple sdl2 ready project. None of the patterns discussed in the course are used (except singleton which use we challenge during the course). It is up to the students to implement their own vision for their engine, apply patterns as they see fit, create their game as efficient as possible.

# Use

Download the latest release of this project and compile/run in visual studio. Since students need to have their work on github too, they can use this repository as a template.
